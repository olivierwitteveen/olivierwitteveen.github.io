Nice to meet you!

I am a PhD student in theoretical biophysics supervised by [prof. Marianne Bauer](https://sites.google.com/view/bauergroup/home) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience](https://kavli.tudelft.nl) in Delft. I use tools from information theory and statistical physics to understand biological systems, particularly gene expression. The expression of genes needs to be regulated precisely, especially when these genes encode proteins that are important for an organisms to develop in a healthy way. How do organisms maintain this regulatory precision, despite the noise in molecular signaling networks?  

Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate student at [Wadham College](https://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. I graduated from the [MMathPhys](https://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk) programme in 2022. At Oxford, I focused on theoretical high-energy physics, and wrote my master's thesis on high-energy scattering in QCD. In the summer of 2021 I was a summer student at the CERN department of theoretical physics, where I studied off-shell Higgs events at the LHC. 

This website serves as a place to store my projects and share them. I hope you find it interesting!
